ls - shows all files

ls -a  - shows all files including hidden files

ls -la - shows the files but has it in a list format instead

## Change filename
mv current_filename new_filename

## You could also change the name and move it to a new directory
mv current_filename LOCATION_FOLDER/new_filename

## Deleting files
rm file_name

## Delete folders :< becareful....
rm -rf directory_name

## Looking at files, or reading content
cat current_filename
  -> it will then show you all the content on that file

## What if you want to write things onto another file?
echo "new content" > current_filename

## :< What if you just want to add something to a file?
### The >> is a append command, which means to just add to a file.
echo "my newer content" >> current_filename

## How about copying?
cp current_filename new_copied_filename
### Then you can check the content
cat new_copied_filename
#### How about copying then moving it to somewhere else?
cp current_filename NEW_LOCATION/new_copied_filename
